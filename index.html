    <div class="about">
        <p>
            Akatsuki is a powerful and mysterious organization from the Naruto anime and manga series. 
            Originally formed with the intention of bringing peace to the world, the group eventually 
            evolved into a rogue organization made up of dangerous rogue ninja from various villages. 
            Each member possesses exceptional skills, unique abilities, and a dark past.
        </p>

    <h3 class="heading">Objective of AKATSUKl</h3>

        
            <div class="objective">
                <p>
                    The primary goal of Akatsuki was to capture all the Tailed Beasts (Bijuu), 
                    powerful creatures sealed within human hosts known as Jinchuriki. By collecting these beasts,
                    the group aimed to harness their immense chakra to create a superweapon capable of forcing the 
                     world into submission—ultimately achieving peace through power and fear. Though their methods were 
                     extreme, Akatsuki's deeper purpose reflected the complex reality of war, pain, and peace in the shinobi world.
